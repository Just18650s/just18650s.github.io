I've added an extra button "Copy to Clipboard".</p><p><strong>16/04/2020</strong></p><p>Updated list of requested features, if you want one of these let us know...</p><ul><li>Put the dimensions screen before the cells screen.</li><li>Allow copy and paste of pack information rather than clicking export</li><li>Include internal resistance as a factor when packing cells</li><li>Allow an ID to be specified for easier identification of a cell</li><li>Allow for cells to be maintained and stored by the website</li><li>Save/edit generated packs</li><li>Handle cells that are left in pairs in packing</li></ul><p>Currently internal resistance is quite highly requested. So any suggestion on how that could be specified along side a capacity would be helpful.</p><p><strong>16/04/2020</strong></p><p>Bit of a gap between updates due to another round of complex changes under the hood. The important part is what's new...</p><p>On the built pack screen there is now a toggle for Compact layout which brings back the layout from the older version as some people found that useful when they are physically building their packs.</p><p>There was a bug in the variable packing that has finally been tracked down, fixing the bug means it's now able to do a better job than before, nothing major.</p><p>And finally, you can now specify the nominal voltage of your cells. This only has the effect of showing the right voltage on the pack summary on the built pack screen. </p><p><strong>08/04/2020</strong></p><p>Few labeling updates for the built pack screens to try make it clearer what is in parallel and in serial.</p><p><strong>07/04/2020</strong></p><p>Few small changes today, stats were showing a higher number of mobile phone users that expected so layout has been optimized a little for those people. </p><p>Finally at the end of the built packs screen it now shows you cells that were not used, and the FAQ explains why this happens. </p><p><strong>06/04/2020</strong></p><p>Feedback has spoken the export to CSV functionality was the most important feature to happen next. It's now available as the "Export CSV" button on the built packs screen.</p><p><strong>03/04/2020</strong></p><p>Recently I've had a bug report or two in feedback, which is very welcome! For me to be able to work with you to fix them please raise any issues <a href="https://github.com/chrisabird/pack-builder/issues">here</a>.</p><p><strong>02/04/2020</strong></p><p>As promised marking cells that are used/found on a built pack is now available again. Some updates to the FAQ's added thanks to feedback and questions left.</p><p>I've distilled all the feedback into the following items that need to be worked on next, let me know which you think should be the next thing to work on...</p><ul><li>Include internal resistance as a factor when packing cells</li><li>Allow an ID to be specified for easier identification of a cell</li><li>Allow for cells to be maintained and stored by the website</li><li>Save generated packs for later</li><li>Edit saved packs</li><li>Show cells not used after packing</li><li>Export to CSV / Excel</li><li>Handle cells that are left in pairs in packing</li></ul><p><strong>31/03/2020</strong></p><p>First release with some changes above and beyond the old version. We now have a less bland layout, and my shocking attempt at graphic design for a logo. There is also the addition of a FAQ page, any questions i get in the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdimZ-OsHEPMzttEdA4oe9n0D-IVdYqb2OQzDQWz-iYY16GKw/viewform?usp=sf_link">feedback</a> i'll answer the best i can here. </p><p>Most importantly the pack builder now lets you specify a capacity for your pack rather than just giving a number of cells to arrange in parallel. This will still result in a pack with a fixed number of cells this just makes it easier to specify the capacity rather than working it out yourself. The last new feature is generated packs now show pack statistics (voltage, Ah and Wh).</p><p>There used to be a feature that let you check off used cells, that will come back soon, oversight on my part while reworking the site. This page will also work as bit of a change log, I'll add things here as I update features.</p><p><strong>29/03/2020</strong></p><p>After a long hiatus, and a lot of feedback gathered from the community I've finally got the time to put into rePackr. This version is almost functionality identical to what has been live for a long time but has huge amount of rework under the covers to allow for new features to be added. as usual any <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdimZ-OsHEPMzttEdA4oe9n0D-IVdYqb2OQzDQWz-iYY16GKw/viewform?usp=sf_link">feedback</a> let me know</p></div></main></div></div></div>
